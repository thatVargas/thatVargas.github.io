### Making software that celebrates creativity

* _"And why write about it? Because this period of translation and exploration has just begun for Casual Creative software. It remains uncategorized, falling into a half-dozen different categories on the app store. The focus of thinkers and researchers, both in academia and in industry, remains focussed on "creativity support tools" and the broad, professional productivity tools, like Maya and Photoshop, while this area remains unexamined. And, for a field of such seemingly simple pieces of software, there's a lot to examine."_

Wondering - if creativity is the new normal, is this kind of software enabling us to think through concepts, kind of like the way artists and designers use sketches to work through a concept before committing it to a more high-fidelity version.  In this vein, I wonder if the idea of a casual creator can branch out and differentiate casual creators from those who use this type of software as a way to wireframe or rapid-prototype ideas before committing heavier resources to them.

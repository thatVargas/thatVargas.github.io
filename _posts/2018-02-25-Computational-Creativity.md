## DH Practice  
  
### Crime, Controversy and the Comments Section
  
* _"I (Winters) am inclined to view it as an option for future content rather than a wholesale replacement of more traditional peer review (despite its imperfections)."_

  Perhaps this is a good intermediary step, in which it retains the seriousness of the traditional academic platforms, but provides some of the accessibility to try to gain new audiences.  

* _"Although most reviewers responded favourably to our requests, some were reluctant to abandon the traditional system and were uncomfortable with committing to a public (perhaps critical) review."_  

  Wondering - Is this also another dimension of the Change management that needs to happen to make people more interested in long-form reading? Do we need to convince the content producers as well, to embrace new forms of more accessible publishing so that they can increase their public profile, and as a result create/improve their status as a credible and quotable source by the public at large, rather than reigning in the obscurity of academic circles?  

* _"This vlog was used to overcome public outreach challenges such as the inaccessibility of the site to people with mobility issues, and a population that were resistant to archaeological interpretations of the Pillar of Eliseg."_ 

  Wondering - It does make me wonder if the additional skillsets of video production, storytelling in different mediums, etc., somehow dilute the power of the narrative message for academia. I.e. Does it take away from time otherwise spent on research and writing, or do things get dropped because they just don‚Äôt work with a medium, that may otherwise increase the academic quality of an output?  

* _"Online activism significantly augments other forms of protest, though it may leave the protestor more open to reprisals"_  

  Wondering - I’d be careful here to make sure to include the fact that it may augment other forms of protest on both sides of the argument. I.e. the ones protesting for as well as against a cause.  

* _"Beyond their use within publication and community building, blogging has been used to identify political issues within archaeology and to advocate for change"_  

  Wonderful - I do like how in this case it is being used to bring transparency to the discipline.   

* _"Legitimate participation is not necessarily tied to professional standing, but by contributions to the larger conversation."_    

  Worrying - But still a conversation that is not necessarily engaged into at-large. I.e. it is still likely being constructed an engaged from an emic vs. etic point of view, which may int turn further alienate people outside of those circles. This is itself is not necessarily problematic, however, when we look to academic circles to expand our understanding of a topic and this content is not accessible (both physically and cognitively) then the skepticism can turn to the content creators, rather than the content itself.   
  
### Spot A Bot  
  
* _"Other metadata similarities may be observed, such as similar screen names, similar profile pictures, similar slogans or hashtags in the user bio, etc. When any of these similarities appear among accounts that exhibit other bot-like or sockpuppet-like traits, there is significant likelihood of a botnet/socknet."_  

  Weird - it is interesting how in this context it seems ok to use metadata to "track down" bots and sock puppets for research purposes by an academic. However, when we hear that the government is doing this with metadata from our cellphones, then we are all up in arms about privacy. This speaks to a mistrust of government, as well as trust in the assumed altruistic nature of academia. On either sides of the coin, this is a trust that can be misplaced.  

* _"It's easy to jump on the bots, but fully automated accounts are only part of the problem when it comes to disinformation and harassment. In addition to bots, which are accounts that are fully automated and controlled by code (or an app) set up by a human user, there are two other categories of high-volume accounts that we have seen in our research"_  

  Worrying - The way the author writes of them here, he makes it sound like these bots came into being on their own ,which is not necessarily the case. These bots are programmed with rules and code that come from a human (the majority of the time), which means that the intent is human, not bot.   So why is this worrying? Because we seem to be ascribing a certain amount of agency to something that does not inherently have it. This also means that at some point, we may seek to ascribe responsibility and accountability to it.   Also worrying is that if we do this for long enough, then we come to believe it. We should never forget where this comes from. We lose our humanity when we give it away or stop being mindful about intent.  
  
### The argument made by the absence 
  
* _"When we ask ourselves, as classicists, why we are such a non-diverse field we must consider whether we make it easy for people of color to want to study the ancient world."_  

  Wondering - I read the term "classicists" and I begin to think of the scent of irony ion that term in the context of this article. While Greece and Rome were very influential in the world, there are also other areas (such as the orient or the Middle East) that also gave us much, and yet we continue with this segregation. I see Bond's argument as pointing out an expression of power based on marble as a raw material, however, the argument itself is couched in a kind of academic hegemony that should also not be ignored. Which is to say that when we speak against bias, we must also remain aware of the context from which we are speaking. To protest is one thing, while to protest from the safety of an "ism" is quite another. I'm not saying we can't do it though, I'm just saying that we need to be mindful of where we speak from, lest it weaken our argument if we come across as hypocritical or naive.  
  
## Economics  
  
### Crime, Controversy and the Comments Section 
  
* _"A variation on the short form can be found in micro-blogging on sharing platforms such as Tumblr, Pinterest, Twitter, and Facebook as well as a myriad of other websites and phone applications."_   

  Wondering - is the decrease of the long-from engagement with content a result of the ever increasing minimization of the tool s and platforms that enable us to increasingly put content out that is shorter and shorter? I.e. does the introduction of concepts such as micro-blogging encourage us to generate content from a stream of consciousness that we rarely return to and edit or correct, and in doing some, trap us in some weird feedback loop in which we are continually looking for our next endorphin fix, rather than seeking to get more informed?   If a platform‚Äôs ability to generate more predictive data on behaviour so that it can then turn around and sell it for profit is dependent on frequency of use, then it seems that corporate and societal goals are at odds on this one, given the platforms want you to keep posting content as often as possible, which could be counter to the goal of giving time to engage with a concept more meaningfully and allow for analysis and the follow-through of skepticism on the claims of a headline or a meme?  
  
### Spot A Bot  
  
* _"Either way, it’s time for Twitter (the free speech wing of the free speech party) to be transparent about what they can’t do, and what they won’t do, in the fight against disinformation."_  

  Overall, what bothers me about this is that it seemingly absolves the human agents, whose goals may be to misinform (on the one hand), and to know when to know better (on the other). While, yes, industry could be doing more to curb this behaviour – I’m reticent to say regulate because it can be a slippery slope to censorship – we as participants in social media – and yes, it is very much a participatory environment – need to also take the lion’s share for disseminating information without reading between the lines, or informing ourselves to be able to question. Playground politics when I was a kid were that if someone was continually expressing behaviour that was not conducive to social cohesion, they would be ignored or fought back on until the behaviour changed. It seems to me that we need to being that back. If we problematize disinformation dissemination by giving our attention elsewhere, the owners of the platforms will respond. They’re in the business of making money, and our attention is our currency.  

* _"One possible explanation is that their advertising tools aren’t as useful and powerful as these companies claim, and advertisers are wasting money when they purchase these services."_  

  Wondering - another is that they could be ignoring them because it pads their numbers. Advertising, after all, is bought and sold based on impressions and qualified leads. Perhaps they may even be filtering the sock puppets and bots from data analysis without telling anyone.   
  
### Javascript is for Girls 
  
* _"But it is often seen by men as a reduction of their status. Because, historically speaking, the more women in a profession, the lower paid it is."_ 

  Wondering - is this because more women enter that profession, or because there are simply more people in that profession? In any economic system, when the demand for a resource stays the same, but the supply goes up, the unit price for that resource goes down (equilibrium price). I'm not trying to dispel the argument, but am simply wondering if the data is being skewed to serve the argument?  
  
## Discourse  
  
### Crime, Controversy and the Comments Section 
  
* _"discuss the current affordances of blogging as a publication format and as a "community of practice," encompassing a network of shared expectations"_ 

  Wondering - does this scale? In that, do the shared expectations change or are they as meaningful the more micro one gets in the medium?  

* _"Her identification of blogging as a continuum of practice, and its relevance to all aspects of disciplinary theory and method, position blogging as one means to insert ourselves into "future world-making""_  

  Wondering - One of the issues with big data is that it can be good at telling us the “what” of a situation, but not particularly good at extracting the “why”. So, I am left wondering if this leaves the future open to misinterpretation , resulting from less engagement with the knowledge that gets produces, or challenging of it in meaningful ways from other points of view, thus creating skews and/or disconnects with its interpretation, and the missing out on the nuances of the “why” in its interpretation?  
  
### Spot A Bot  
  
* "_Twitter is not a neutral platform. The specific affordances, limitations, and policies of the platform facilitate certain kinds of user behavior, and Twitter's employees make choices about how to respond (or not) to that behavior, and how to tweak the platform in light of the ways it is used."_   

  Wondering - I find it interesting how we have come to think of social media as needing to keep this public good concept in mind. It really speaks to the power of it, especially since we seem to be saying that we need to have arbiters and facilitators to make sure that we're all ‚Äúplaying nice‚Äù.   This also makes me wonder, does social media at some point start inscribing values unto society, rather than the other way around?  
  
### Twitter propaganda during ‘Unite the Right  
  
* _"the majority of the tweets are generated by a much smaller minority of high-volume accounts. The top 10% of accounts by tweet volume account for approximately 50% of the tweets, and the top 5% of accounts generated approximately 37% of the tweets."_  

  Wondering - How different is this from the more traditional media? In other words, although social media allows for anyone to have a voice, we seem to gravitate towards a small subset of the available voices on social media platforms, perhaps replicating the structure of more traditional media as a way of prioritizing information by assigning credibility to a smaller subset of content creators.  
  
## Media Literacy  
  
### Crime, Controversy and the Comments Section 
  
* _"Twitter relies on 140 word updates"_ 

  Wondering - is this a typo or a lack of understanding of the medium? The irony is not lost on me here if it is the latter. It does, however, speak to the fact that we may not always fully understand the underlying infrastructures and support and/or obstruct our abilities o communicate or even engage with ideas or each other. Which may lead to additional interactions with them, as we seek to ensure that our messages to the work are in fact being heard by someone.  
  
### Spot A Bot  
  
* _"network of signal-boosters"_ 

  Wonderful - I really like this as a metaphor, given that there is so much content out there these days, the while concept of noise-to-signal ratio becomes  very relevant.  
  
## Misinformation  
  
### Spot A Bot  
  
* _"Other times it is more subtle. For example, rather than automating the content creation, the perpetrators may be coordinating efforts on another site (4chan, Reddit, Discord, etc.) and reproducing language from a shared script, but doing so non-uniformly."_  

  Weird - not only is this classic misinformation and propaganda, but it. Also very familiar as marketing tactics, as a way of creating top of mind awareness for something by saturating information channels with your message. If this message can become memetic and viral, all the better!  
  
### The argument made by the absence 
  
* _"This assemblage of neon whiteness thus creates a false sense of homogeneity across the Mediterranean world."_  

  Wondering - This is an interesting parallel to the notion that we may be creating a similar "false sense of homogeneity" in ideas through the prevalence of disinformation campaigns and tactics through online media platforms that go largely unchallenged by the masses. Does this kind of distortion affect, not only the present, but how we look back on this in the future? Are we capturing enough of the nuances "at the margins" so as to be able to get a more fulsome sense of the present discourse in the future? Will we be able to draw the conclusions of cause and effect from a possibly incomplete historical record?  
  
### Twitter propaganda during ‘Unite the Right  
  
* _"Censorship is no longer a silencing of a voice by force, but a flooding of the information landscape with so much disinformation that the truth is covered."_  

  I would say that although a different kind of force, this is still force nonetheless. It is the overpowering of an individual (in this case from a cognitive perspective) into accepting a certain point of view.   

* _"The lack of expert, edited journalism on this list should be a caution to all of us when we participate in the mass quick-fire retweeting of updates during a breaking event."_  

  Wondering - What do we call "expert, edited journalism" these days? I have heard pointed views from journalists on either side of the ideological divide. I do think that we need to be careful to differentiate between correct and incorrect statements, versus truths. You can support any argument with the arguments or others and re-interpretation of data. So, I would caution us, as practitioners in the humanities, to judge the veracity of content (or content providers) because we have differing points of view. This is not to negate the fact that misinformation happens and that there are its agents out there. I am merely stating that we would do well to remain agnostic in our analysis to avoid biasing our outputs as knowledge producers one way or another.  

* _"Misinformation thrives during terror attacks and other breaking stories."_   

  Sociologist Fritz Staal once wrote, "We are most anxious when we don't know what we are anxious about". In most situations in which our assumptions of the world or of the sequence of events in a situation are upended in shocking ways, we immediately begin to look for ways in which to make sense of it all. It is as if the shock is so great, that we have no way of assimilating the information into our mental models to be able to begin to process it. This is where misinformation thrives, in an environment in which people are furiously searching for some kind of key that will let them begin the process of transposition of reality into their mental models, so that they can begin to extract meaning from the situation for themselves. If we then couple that with the precept of Ockham's razor (wherein it states that given a variety of options to explain a situation it is more often than not the simplest explanation that is the correct one), then the misinformation agent(s) just have to find something that is simple enough to be plausible, and present it at the right time. This creates a kind of scent for this (mis)information that strengthens over time as it is shared, consumed and re-shared.

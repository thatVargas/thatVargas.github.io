However, given that you will likely have no idea of who I am, I will do my best to briefly fill in that blank... not in the third person.</p>

<P>My name is Álvaro Vargas and I am a user experience (UX) designer, self-professed people nerd, and a thoughtsmith.</p>

<P>My path towards user experience design went something like this: studied advertising, first job out of school was graphic designer, worked for a new media company as a coder and information architect, started my own new media company, sold it and worked as a management consultant specializing in e-learning and change management, went back to school for anthropology, and finally began work in the public service in communications, which brought me back to UX, and that pretty much brings you up to date.</p>

<P>My approach to UX comes from three disciplines: advertising, graphic design, and anthropology. The connecting principle between them is a genuine interest in people, and the interfaces between people, process, policy, and technology. I see UX as an outcome, and not just a process for execution.</p> 

<P>I am presently a UX designer and researcher for the Government of Canada, working with colleagues to improve the user experiences for Candaians through a variety of products and services.</p>

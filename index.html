			<h1>So, you're here...</h1>
			<p>Welcome. I'm Álvaro. This will be a growing repository of content as I go through my journey into the Digital Humanities. My end goal is to use what I learn to create more meaningful user experiences.
			<p>This site is my DH Bookbook. You can also read my other stuff at <a href="http://workisplay.com">workisplay</a>. At some point I may even merge them.</p>
			<P> While you're here, why not <a href=/blog/>check out what's new in the blog</a>?
